Since she has little to no friends here, I would always welcome her to come out with my friends and I whenever we went partying. I didn’t mind - she’s not so bad to hang out with (but sometimes she’s annoying lol). It did change the dynamics a bit as I feel like I can’t be 100% myself with my friends when my sister is around, but I toughed it out because it wasn’t a frequent thing.

Recently she moved back home and she has been here for around 5 months. She has absolutely no friends in our country, and I feel like every time I go out I need to invite her. I usually don’t mind, but this time around I really want to spend new years with my boyfriend and his friends.

They want to buy tickets to a banquet hall which will include food, drinks, and dancing.

Last week I went to a party with my sister and boyfriend and it was kind of awkward for the three or us. My sister wanted to dance with me, and we had to leave my bf behind at our table. And when my bf wanted to dance with me, he hesitated because he was uncomfortable to do so in front of my sister.

I felt torn between the two of their attentions, and I honestly didn’t have a great time.

I don’t want the same thing to happen for new years. I also feel guilty for not inviting my sister to join us - but a part of me knows it is also not my responsibility to ensure she is happy.

I know she was expecting me to invite her out, but I really don’t want to.

So, Reddit. Would I be the jerk for not inviting my sister out for new years?

Other info: she already asked me two months ago if we could go out for new years. I expressed to her that since I have a boyfriend, I am going to make him my priority to go out with on new years. We haven’t really talked about it since.'''))
